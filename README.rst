testaid fixtures for ansible, molecule and testinfra

About
=====

With the pytest_ plugin testinfra_ you can write unit tests in python to test
your servers configured by the management tool ansible_. testinfra is the
default verifier_ of the molecule_ testing environment.

The pytest plugin testaid_ provides helper functions and fixtures to facilitate
the use of testinfra. It helps to not only unit test your ansible roles but to
integration and system test your whole ansible project.

testinfra wraps cli_ calls to the ansible executable.
testaid uses the ansible python api_ to run ansible playbooks.

=======

Quick start
===========

Install the testaid plugin_ using pip_::

    $ pip install testaid

.. _plugin: https://pypi.org/project/testaid/
.. _pip: https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/

Tests
=====

Run ``molecule test`` by invoking tox_::

    $ tox

.. _tox: https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#

Example
========

Have a look at *test/debian* for an example of a molecule project
using ansible, testinfra and testaid.
The molecule project doubles as as a system test for the testaid plugin.

Boilerplate
===========

As a boilerplate for testinfra tests it is enough to do:

.. code-block:: python

    import testaid

    testinfra_hosts = testaid.hosts()

Fixture testpass
================

You can access gopass_ secrets by using the testpass fixture:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_mytest(host, testpass):

        my_password = testpass('my_project/my_password')

.. _gopass: https://www.gopass.pw/

Fixture testvars
================

Arguably the most useful feature of the testaid plugin is the testvars fixture.
The fixture exposes and resolves ansible variables as a python dict:

.. code-block:: python

    def test_mytest(host, testvars):

        my_variable = testvars['my_variable']

testvars runs a playbook against the molecule host using the ansible python api.

testvars creates a symbolic link to the roles directory of your ansible project
in the ephemeral playbook environment which molecule sets up.
It then runs a playbook with ``gather_facts:true`` and a debug_ task to get
the ansible variables and the ansible facts of the play and host.

testvars uses the ansible VariableManager_
so the usual ansible variable precedence_ rules apply.
Internally, the fixture uses the ansible debug_ module to resolve templates.
Thus, it can resolve any kind of template that the debug module can resolve
including jinja2_ code and calls to lookup_ plugins.

extra vars
----------

The ``TESTAID_EXTRA_VARS`` environment variable can be set in *molecule.yml*.
It can contain dirpaths or filepaths relative to the
``MOLECULE_SCENARIO_DIRECTORY`` separated by colons:

.. code-block:: yaml

    verifier:
      name: testinfra
      env:
        TESTAID_EXTRA_VARS: "../../vars:../../extra_vars/extra_vars.yml"

The vars files will be included in moleculebook playbooks by adding
the paths to ``vars_files`` (and not by adding ``include_vars`` tasks).

options
-------
testvars is a session scope fixture so its configuration is done in
*molecule.yml* by using pytest command line options.
You can add a couple of options in the options dictionary
of the verifier section:

.. code-block:: yaml

    verifier:
      name: testinfra
      options:
        testvars-no-gather-facts: true

These options exist:

- ``testvars-no-resolve-vars``
    Do not resolve any jinja2 template.
    Variables are read from disk instead.
    No playbook will be run to gather information.
    This option might speed up some unit tests considerably.
    Implies ``testvars-no-gather-facts``
    and ``testvars-no-gather-molecule``.
- ``testvars-no-gather-facts``
    Run playbook to gather variables with ``gather_facts: false``.
    You won't be able to access ``ansible_facts``
    but your tests will run much faster.
- ``testvars-no-gather-molecule``
    Do not resolve molecule variables.
    You probably won't need these variables
    but it won't take much time to gather them, either.
- ``testvars-no-extra-vars``
    Do not add extra variables specified in ``TESTAID_EXTRA_VARS``.

caching
-------

Hopefully the testvars fixture allows fast test-driven development.
It has `session` scope so variables are collected and resolved only once
per testrun as pytest caches the result.
If this is still too slow for you then you can enable the pytest cache_ plugin
in *molecule.yml*:

.. code-block:: yaml

    verifier:
      name: testinfra
      options:
        p: cacheprovider

You should use the testaid boilerplate code to be able to run pytest directly.
Otherwise testinfra will complain about missing environment variables.

Remember to clear the cache when you add or change an ansible variable::

    pytest --cache-clear; molecule verify

The cache will use the molecule ephemeral directory as the cache key which
is unique for each molecule instance.
When using the boilerplate you can inspect the cache by running::

    pytest --cache-show

.. _cache: https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/cache.html

Ansible Python API
==================

The testaid plugin provides four pytest fixtures:

- testpass - exposes the ansible passwordstore_ plugin
- testvars - resolves and exposes ansible vars and facts
- moleculebook - api to run playbooks against a molecule host
- moleculeplay - api to leverage the ansible python api

The testvars and testpass fixtures use the moleculebook fixture which in turn
uses the moleculeplay fixture. moleculeplay handles the sysadmin tasks
of setting the right symlinks and it makes low-level calls to the
`ansible python api`_. It will probably not be very useful on its own
but moleculebook might be handy in those situations where you know you
shouldn't implement a hackaround. ;-)

Here is how you could run an ansible playbook programmatically from 
a test or even better: from a fixture_ using dependency injection.

.. code-block:: python

    def test_testaid_moleculebook(host, moleculebook):
        playbook = moleculebook.get()
        args = dict(path='/tmp/moleculebook_did_this', state='touch')
        task_touch = dict(action=dict(module='file', args=args))
        playbook['tasks'].append(task_touch)
        moleculebook.set(playbook)
        moleculebook.run()
        assert host.file('/tmp/moleculebook_did_this').exists
